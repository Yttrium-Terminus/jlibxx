# Java Standard Libary++ (jlib++)

A work in progress where I add stuffs that I find to be useful and an interesting addition to the standard library.

Feel free to send a pull request

# Support
Currently this library supports Java8 and above.

Most stable with Java11

# Setup
Download this repository as a ZIP and unpack it, then `import` alongside anything else

It is recommended to build everything before importing. This means compiling these files to `*.class` (I will incorporate a workflow to do this automatically)

# Plans
I plan to release this as a package for Gradle however this might be very unlikely, and could just be stagnant library downloaded straight from the lib.

Plans to make a website to easily download stuffs related
