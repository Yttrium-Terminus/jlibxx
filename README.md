# Java Standard Libary++ (jlib++)

A work in progress where I add stuffs that I find to be useful and an interesting addition to the standard library.

*Please Note: This library is not trying to alter anything this means you still must have the standard library, while this is just a small extension of it to allow more features :D*

Feel free to send a pull request

# Support
Currently this library supports Java8 and above.

Most stable with Java11

# Setup
You should download this file for easier processing and installation of this library

`THIS IS AN EXTREME WORK IN PROGRESS` [Install.sh](./install/Install.sh) - *Nix or Bash avaliable systems with Root Permissions

Easier access will come for Win32 users

# Plans
I plan to release this as a package for Gradle however this might be very unlikely, and could just be stagnant library downloaded straight from the lib.

Plans to make a website to easily download stuffs related

# Repository Workings
Everytime something new is being worked on, the master branch would be forked and the feature would be added in this new branch, which would then be PRed back to the
master branch.

This means the master branch would be considered the "stable" branch
